The first major move away from classifying autism and intellectual disabilities as 'spiritual acts' of rejecting the norm was in the 1920s."

      year: "1920s",
      content: "The first major breakthrough was in Russia in the 1920s, and although the paper published by Grunya Sukhareva didn't make it to the western world, her impact on psychiatry did. Sukhareva identified many key attributes of autism based on her work with over 1000 children."

      year: "1940s",
      content: "The well-known Hans Asperger conducted 'research' on several young boys with, what was seen as, low-need, high intelligence autism. Based on inhumane treatment of autistic children, Asperger's Syndrome was created."

    {
      year: "1960s",
      content: "Neurodiverse traits were seen as medical problems, things that needed to be fixed or removed from society. Much of the research conducted in this decade was based on life experiences, viewing autistic people as traumatised individuals."

    {
      year: "1980s & 1990s",
      content: "The DSM-5 adapted their definition of autism, adding diagnostic criteria based on new scientific information. Federal governments started to identify and provide special services for children with autism in school."

      year: "Early 2000s",
      content: "Barack Obama removed the term 'r*tardation' from all federal records in line with \"Rosa's Law\". In 2014, the diagnostic manual evolved, blending different branches of autism into one ASD umbrella diagnosis."

      year: "Present",
      content: "The first Self-Assessment of Autistic Traits, by and for autistic adults, was released in 2022. Social media has played a vital role in autism awareness and acceptance, particularly for people raised female. The autism spectrum has been reimagined with a more nuanced understanding."
